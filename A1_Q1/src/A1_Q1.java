This program is made to calculate an approximate caloric expenditure based on a person's weight and predefined activities'
durations. The time values for each activity is scanned and stored in an array. This array is passed through a function designed to
calculate the caloric expenditure and return them under the form of another array. Sum is evaluated and results are printed.
